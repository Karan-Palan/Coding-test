I imported Web3.js, obtained the contract's ABI, created a contract instance, and used an asynchronous function to fetch the balance. I then updated the button's title with this balance, ensuring proper TypeScript typings and preserving all original code comments.

the only change you need to do is add web3js and paste this code
`npm i web3`
